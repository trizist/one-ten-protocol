\opening{Dear Editors,}

I am pleased to submit my chapter, **“Convergent Truth: Engineering Narrative Integrity in Post-Hallucination AI Systems,”** for consideration in the *Springer Nature AI \& Society* series.

This work introduces the **One Ten Protocol**—a deterministic framework that transforms real-world device metadata (time, battery, storage, file size) into verified, poetic narratives called **Chronicles**. By grounding AI outputs in physical observables and requiring cross-domain convergence across twelve analytical lenses (spanning mathematics, material science, and the humanities), the protocol offers a structural antidote to the hallucination endemic in contemporary generative systems.

The chapter bridges quantum engineering, environmental AI (e.g., SonicFilter for water filtration), and artistic data practice (e.g., Black Hole Archives), reflecting my dual role as a researcher and independent artist. It aligns with Springer’s commitment to “responsible innovation” and “interdisciplinary solutions to societal challenges.”

This is original, unpublished work not under consideration elsewhere. All code is open-source (\url{https://github.com/trizist/one-ten-protocol}), and all outputs are reproducible and checksummed.

Thank you for considering this contribution to a more truthful, accountable AI future.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
