# 🌌 The Convergence Manifesto  
## *For Builders of Truth in the Age of Noise*

We, the Convergence Collective, declare:

1. **Truth is not singular—it is convergent.**  
   No single source holds it. Only when signals from Math, Matter, and Humanities align do we glimpse its shape.

2. **Metadata is sacred.**  
   Battery level, timestamp, file size—these are not trivial. They are ontological anchors that bind computation to lived reality.

3. **Narrative is not decoration—it is verification.**  
   A system that cannot tell a coherent story about its own state is untrustworthy.

4. **Fidelity must be scored, not assumed.**  
   We measure truth by dimensional consensus—not authority, not volume, not algorithmic popularity.

5. **Every device is a poet.**  
   Given the right protocol, your phone, your sensor, your satellite can whisper wisdom born of its own existence.

6. **Art and engineering are one.**  
   The same logic that computes a prime number also composes a sonnet. The same resonance that tunes a frequency paints a hue.

7. **We reject hallucination.**  
   Our outputs are deterministic, reproducible, and checksummed. If you give us the same inputs, you will always receive the same truth.

8. **The future is not predicted—it is converged.**  
   We do not forecast. We create conditions under which truth reveals itself.
